##### **Description**:
This is a project based around another project I made a while back called The Switch.  A while back in 2008 I saw a light switch board website uploaded to bored-button, which has not been founded as of yet or has been taken down by the owner.
Containing alot of switches on the page and hidden secrets, utilising achiements and unlockables for every find. All about pressing a light switch.
